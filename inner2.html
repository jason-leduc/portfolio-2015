				<p>In this project I designed an isometric illustration of a process in Adobe Illustrator.</p>


				<h2>What is Isometric Illustration?</h2>

				<p>Isometric illustration is a type of 3D illustration. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, those lines are parallel. Isometric illustration is a very functional type of illustration which can communicate a message in a simple way that other styles cannot. It's both fun and very effective. And the process is at once challenging and rewarding.</p>

				<h2>My Concept</h2>

				<p>I concieved a concept for an isometric illustration through research of common processes and a lot of sketching. I wanted the theme to be obvious to a majority of people. The process I wanted to explain in my illustration was <em>How we get our electrical power.</em></p>

				<p>I started off by creating simple, flat & isometric sketches. These were sketched out completey in an isometric view on a grid. I needed to figure out what I was going to draw and how I was going to do it. I broke down individual objects into their constituant parts and scenes in isometric view on a grid.</p>

				
				<p>By the end of the project I was successfully able to use the Colour Guide to create tonal families in Adobe Illustrator, Create actions to automate tasks in Adobe Illustrator, use the Appearance palette to create Graphic Styles, use Isolation Mode in Illustrator to edit groups, and use plugins added to Illustrator to enhance its functionality.</p>
