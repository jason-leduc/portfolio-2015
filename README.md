# I'm Jason Leduc, a Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.

I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincindentally, a graphic designer.

I want to be able to use the experience I gained during my time in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College to help people all over the world bring their brand ideas to life. I want to be able to help businesses and individuals who are passionate about what they do.

During my *free time* I enjoy working on my own side projects. This helps me stay fresh in what I do and provides me with personal challenges to experience.

## My passions....

I am passionate about exploring art and other aspects of visual culture. I also enjoy learning about the intersection of art and science as well as the beauty of the natural world.
