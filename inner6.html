				<p> I was tasked with creating a mini dingbat font comprised of 10 glyphs using any combination of image & text. Typographic lettering could be hand made (hand drawn or scrawled) or outlined & styled. Actual images can be vectorized images or hand-drawn or computer generated images. I chose a unifying theme for my dingbats and ensured all characters/glyphs had the same style and weight and fit together as a cohesive group.</p>


				<h2>What is a dingbat?</h2>

				<p>A dingbat is a typographical device other than a letter or numeral (such as an asterisk), used to signal divisions in text or to replace letters in a euphemistically presented vulgar word.</p>

				<h2>My Idea</h2>

				<p>I decided to create a dinbat collection based upon the Chinese Zodiac. I chose this theme because I have some Asian ancestry and my family celebrates Chinese New Year every year.</p>

				<p>Instead of illustrating the twelve animals of the zodiac, I decided to use the symbols that represent each animal. I thought that this would give that whole piece a more traditional and unified look. Each symbol is place in a hexagon which further unifies the design overall. I chose to place the characters in a hexagon because I have a hexagonal shaped Chinese Checker Board.</p>

				
				<p>This design is fully usable with any text editing software! Each character is mapped to a corresponding key. For example, the rat is the first animal in the zodiac so it's corresponding key on the keyboard is the number one. The tenth animal is the rooster so it is mapped to the number 0 on the keyboard. The dog and the pig are the 11th and 12th animals in the zodiac. Since there are no 11 and 12 keys I decided to tie them to the <em>!</em> and <em>@</em> symbools.</p>
