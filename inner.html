				<p>In this project I wanted to include as many of the skills I have learned to date in Photoshop. Movie Poster designs are a perfect fit for a Photoshop project! They're chalk-full of photoshop layering and effects.</p>


				<h2>My Effort</h2>

				<p>This was not a project in which to be minimalist. I wanted to find a balance between overloading the piece with gratuitous Photoshop effects and artful use of the tools I learned to use effectively.</p>

				<h2>My major goal was to maintain editability</h2>

				<p>This was the main goal of this project. Making sure to isolate graphics on layers. Use masks to erase areas, not erase actual pixels, using Clipping Masks, etc.</p>

				<p>Some editing was destructive, like use of the transform tool, for example. This is why I saved copies of all of your untouched images in a separate folder. Whenever possible, I duplicated the layer before I did a destructive transformation.</p>

				
				<p>I wanted to make sure that my design looked like a movie piece with extraordinary visuals which people have come to expect from movie posters.</p>
              
              <p>No matter what the subject was, I needed to design my own identity for it and make it appropriate and original.</p>
              
              <p>I wanted to go in really heavily with the Photoshop effects but made sure that I did  this in a considered way. Do not use effects for nothing. Make them appropriate to the movie.</p>
