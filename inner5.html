				<p>I chose to redesign the worst loking logo in my professional opinion. This logo was to be of a small business that is located in Canada. It could not be a national corporation or well-known industry or business. I wanted to find one that I could really sink my teeth into and create a dynamic design.</p>


				<h2>My Personal Objectives</h2>

				<p>I wanted to demonstrate a variety of skills when redesigning this logo. I wanted to show my creative thinking process with original concepts, my knowledge and ability to work through the stages of designing a logo, my know-how about producinging a logo that can be used with any medium and size, and my proficiency in developinging a logo within a 2 colour parameter.</p>

				<h2>Creative Process</h2>

				<p>Sketching in this process helped me with potential directions. At this point I did not have a particular direction, only direction possibilities. During this time I explored and allowed my creative juices to flow. I started off by sketching  all my ideas onto paper until there was nothing left. When I had nothing left I walked away and engaged myself in another activity, playing guitar, a different environment with different exposures. This helped me refresh and recharge. Thumbnail sketches helped me discover what to do and what not to do. Itâ€™s about drawing out tons of rough ideas in order to select a short list of strong directions that I can move forward with. </p>

				<p>By analyzing and processing visual information in unique ways through shape association it greatly helped me condition my mind to formulate conceptual ideas.</p>

				
				<p>Selecting the right style is curial. Styles have personalities that can repeal or attract certain audiences. I believe that my style choices reflected attributes of my creative research and the company.</p>
