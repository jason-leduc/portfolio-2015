				<h2>I'm Jason Leduc, a Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.</h2>

<p>I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincindentally, a graphic designer.</p>

<p>I want to be able to use the experience I gained during my time in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College to help people all over the world bring their brand ideas to life. I want to be able to help businesses and individuals who are passionate about what they do.</p>

<p>During my free time I enjoy working on my own side projects. This helps me stay fresh in what I do and provides me with personal challenges to experience.</p>

<h2>My passions....</h2>

<p>I am passionate about exploring art and other aspects of visual culture. I also enjoy learning about the intersection of art and science as well as the beauty of the natural world.</p>
