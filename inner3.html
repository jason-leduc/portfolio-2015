				<p>I was tasked to design a 16-page self-cover booklet using only TYPE. Some sort of hand-made type aspect had to be included in the booklet in order to  contrast the hand made with only ONE type family.</p>


				<h2>My objectives for this project...</h2>

				<p>...to explore type as image and effectively use creative typography. Create visual flow and consistency throughout a document. Design with provided specifications and guidelines. Use grid systems and advanced layout techniques. Build properly composed InDesign files. Refine creative and technical publication design skills.</p>

				<h2>Theme and Content</h2>

				<p>The theme I chose is the the band <em>Red Hot Chili Peppers</em>. I chose this band specifically because they are my all time favourite musical group and I thought it would be cool to create a small promo piece.</p>

				<p>As for the content of my piece, I wanted to include a mixture of their most well known songs and some of my personal favourites. </p>

				<h2>Hand-made Type</h2>
              
				<p>Because they are known as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I thought that it would be appropriate to create a typeface out of chili peppers. I did this by arranging the peppers into the shapes of letters and then editing the photos in Photoshop. I had to do quite a bit of editing... I arranged the peppers letter by letter and photographed each one. I then spelled out the song titles using the indivdual characters. I also had to colour correct the peppers because when I bought them they were originally green. The front and back covers for the booklet were made in Illustrator using simple polygons.</p>
